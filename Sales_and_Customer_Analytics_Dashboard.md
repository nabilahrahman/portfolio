## Sales and Customer Analytics Dashboard:

This dashboard gives a detailed overview of key business metrics like total sales, total orders, active customers, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and churn rate. I built it using Power BI to help businesses understand customer behavior and sales performance at a glance. Some of the other metrics included are Average Customer Lifespan (ACL) , Average Purchase Frequency (APF), Average Purchase Value (APV), and average revenue per customer.

I used Power BIâ€™s DAX functions to calculate these metrics and created interactive visuals with filters so users can dive deeper into specific time periods or customer segments. This project is a great example of how I can take raw data and turn it into meaningful insights that businesses can use to improve customer retention and boost revenue.
